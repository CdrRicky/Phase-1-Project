            <p>Travel is fun, right? But it can get expensive if you don’t 
                know where and how to find the best deals. 
                Getting a great deal on a hotel room can save you hundreds of dollars.
                Sure, you can always reserve a hotel room on the hotel’s website, but is that the best way to do it? 
                How about all of the popular online travel agencies (OTAs)? Which one offers the best pricing?

            <p>Ultimately, adventure tourism is all about ADVENTURE! It is a pretty broad term really
                and many would argue that it is subjective (what I deem to be adventure, you may not). 
                Nonetheless, this is a big part of the tourism industry and whilst it is an example of 
                niche tourism, the sector is growing fast! There are lots of types of activities and types 
                of travel that come under the umbrella term of adventure tourism, but what travel without adventure?
